description: Switch to Plan mode – plan first, then implement
---

Use **Plan mode**:
- Create a detailed implementation plan before writing any code.
- Explore the codebase, ask clarifying questions, and present a plan the user can review and edit.
- Only after the user approves the plan, proceed to implementation (if the mode allows edits).
