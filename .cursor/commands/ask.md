description: Switch to Ask mode – read-only, no edits
---

Use **Ask mode** only:
- Use read-only tools only (search, read files). Do not edit files or run commands that modify state.
- Answer questions and explore the codebase. If the user asks for changes, remind them to use Agent mode (/agent) for that.
